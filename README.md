# barbara-final-project-239T
Barbara's final project for PS 239T.

All documents related to this project should be in this folder. If something is missing, please contact me and I'd be happy to re-upload missing files.

My work begins with defining the chowkidar_proportions measure, which can be found in the `01_Chowkidar_Proportions.ipynb` file.
Then, my analysis is split in two parts: offline characteristics and online characteristics (the tweets).
The offline analysis can be found in `02_Offline_Analysis.py`, and the code that generated the map can be found in `03_Chowkidar_Map.ipynb`.
The analysis of the tweets can be found in `04_Text_Analysis.ipynb`.
